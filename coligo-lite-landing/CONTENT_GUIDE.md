  "subheadline": "Request a live demo and discover how you can deploy<br>anomaly detection, predictive insights, and streaming AI<br>directly into your IoT system â€” without coding"
}
```

```

**Notes:**

  "items": [
    {
      "question": "How long is the demo?",

}
```

**Notes:**

- `links`: Array of navigation links
- Each link has `text` (displayed) and `url` (destination)
- You can add or remove links as needed

## Adding/Removing Items

### To Add More Features or FAQ Items:

Simply add more objects to the `features` or `items` array:

```json
{
  "icon": "ðŸš€",
  "title": "New Feature",
  "description": "Description of the new feature"
}
```

### To Remove Features or FAQ Items:

Delete the entire object from the array, making sure to maintain valid JSON syntax (check commas).

## Important Notes

1. **Valid JSON**: Make sure your JSON is valid. Use a JSON validator if needed.
2. **Quotation Marks**: Always use double quotes `"` for JSON strings, not single quotes.
3. **Commas**: Don't forget commas between items, but no comma after the last item in an array.
4. **HTML Support**: The headline and subheadline support HTML tags like `<br>`.
5. **Emojis**: You can use emojis in the icons field or replace them with text.

## Testing Your Changes

1. Edit `content-config.json`
2. Save the file
3. Refresh your browser (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Your changes should appear immediately

## Troubleshooting

If content doesn't appear:
1. Check the browser console for errors (F12)
2. Validate your JSON syntax using an online JSON validator
3. Make sure all quotes and commas are in the right place
4. Ensure the file is saved as `content-config.json` in the root directory

## About package.json

**Important:** The `package.json` file is a separate technical configuration file that manages backend dependencies (like SendGrid email service) and should NOT be edited for website content.

- `package.json` = Backend/server configuration (dependencies, scripts)
- `content-config.json` = Website content (text, headings, links)

Keep these files separate to maintain a clean separation between technical setup and content management.
